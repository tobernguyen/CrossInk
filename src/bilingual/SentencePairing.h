// Shared sentence-level source <-> translation alignment.
//
// Two consumers need exactly the same answer to "which translated sentence belongs to this source
// sentence?", so the rule lives here once instead of in each of them:
//   * TooltipOverlay  — builds a key -> translation index at view time and shows one unit per press;
//   * LinguaLayout::Interlinear — forces each sentence to start a line and emits its annotation row above it.
// Both must feed it the same WORDS, which is not automatic: the tooltip reads laid-out page words,
// while Interlinear reads a ParsedText before layout, and with Focus Reading on that block stores a
// bold prefix and a regular tail as two tokens ("O" + "k"). Interlinear merges them back
// (buildMergedWordStream) precisely so the answers below cannot depend on a display setting.
// It used to live only in TooltipOverlay.cpp, whose TU pulls GfxRenderer / Page / HalStorage and
// therefore cannot link on the native host; the host test kept a hand-copied MIRROR of the grouping
// rule in sync by comment. This TU is pure text logic (SentenceSplitter + std::string), is listed in
// the `native` env's build_src_filter, and is tested directly.
//
// Everything here is deterministic and allocation-light: the only heap it touches is the caller's
// output strings. All fixed-size scratch lives in SentencePairScratch, which the CALLER owns — the
// three arrays total ~800 bytes, well past the <256 B stack-local budget, so it must not be a local.

// Per-source-sentence alignment state for ONE paragraph pair. Owned by the caller (heap, via
// makeUniqueNoThrow) and reused across pairs, so the mapping costs no per-paragraph allocation.
// The split results are outputs too: callers read origSplits to get each source sentence's word
// span.
struct SentencePairScratch {
  SentenceSplitResult origSplits;   // source sentence spans (word indices into the source array)
  SentenceSplitResult transSplits;  // translation sentence spans
  // Per SOURCE sentence os in [0, origSplits.count): the translation word span mapped to it.
  // startWord >= endWord means "no translation" (never emitted / never a step).

  int origWordCount = 0;
  int transWordCount = 0;
  // Internal: translation sentence midpoints as a fraction of the paragraph's character length.

// Split both sides of a paragraph pair into sentences. Returns false (and leaves transFor untouched)
// when either side has no words or no sentence, which is the caller's "nothing to align" signal.

// Merge "junk" sentences — a stray "." from a spaced ellipsis, a short fragment left by a page
// boundary — into the preceding sentence, so they never become a navigation step or an annotation
// row of their own. A sentence is junk when its match key is empty, or is <= 2 bytes over <= 3
// words. Walks backwards so a run of junk collapses in one pass. No-op for a single sentence.
//
// `runStarts` / `runCount` are the paragraph-run table (see splitSentencesByParagraph): a junk
// sentence that BEGINS a paragraph is left alone, because folding it backwards would pull the
// previous paragraph's words into it and undo the very boundary the split just made — a bare
// numeral heading ("1") or a paragraph opening with a stray dot is exactly that case. Omit the table
// (the default) to merge with no boundary constraint, which is what a single-paragraph caller wants.

// Map every source sentence in scratch.origSplits to a translation word span in scratch.transFor.
//
// THE RULE (unchanged from the original TooltipOverlay implementation): both sides are measured in
// cumulative characters; each translation sentence gets a midpoint expressed as a fraction of the
// translated paragraph; a source sentence takes every translation sentence whose midpoint falls in
// its own [startFrac, endFrac); if none does, it takes the single closest midpoint. Because the
// midpoints are monotonic and splitSentences' spans are contiguous, the matching translation
// sentences are always a contiguous run — which is why one span can express what used to be a
// joined string, at no loss (equal span <=> byte-identical text).
//
// Call splitSentencePair (and optionally mergeJunkSentences) first.

// translation. firstSentence..lastSentence are indices into the source sentence array.
struct SentenceStep {

};

// Collapse consecutive source sentences that resolve to the SAME translation into one step.
//
// Two mapping paths produce such duplicates: the engine merged K source sentences into ONE
// translated sentence (so all K map to the same translated span), or an unmatched sentence
// inherited a neighbour's translation via gap-fill. Without this the user sees the identical
// tooltip several presses in a row, and Interlinear would print the identical annotation row K
// times — the photo-verified LINGUA_TOOLTIP bug. Empty (untranslated) sentences are never a step and
// terminate a run, so a page-boundary partial sentence stays out of a group's span.
//
// Two entry points, ONE rule (see the shared implementation in the .cpp):
//   * the string form is what the tooltip has after key matching + gap-fill;
//   * the span form is what mapSentenceSpans produces directly, and lets the layout path emit
//     translated words with no intermediate string at all.
// Returns the number of steps written (<= maxSteps).
